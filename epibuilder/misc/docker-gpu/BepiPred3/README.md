# BepiPred-3.0-Predictor
BepiPred-3.0 predicts B-cell epitopes from ESM-2 encodings of protein sequences. 

### Installation ###
BepiPred-3.0 is built in python and you will therefore need a basic python installation. We used python version 3.8.8. 
The dependencies for the BepiPred-3.0 are listed in 'requirements.txt'.
These dependencies can be installed with pip. It is recommended that you install the dependencies in a virtual environment. 
To do this, use do the 3 steps hereunder in your CLI.

1. 
#Create python virtual environment 
$ python -m venv <venv_name>

2. 
#Activate virtual environment on Windows OS
.\<venv_name>\Scripts\activate.bat
#Activate virtual environment on Linux or MAC OS
source ./<venv_name>/bin/activate

3.
#Install pip packages 
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt


### Usage ###

A commandline script for most general use cases is provided in (bepipred3_CLI.py). It takes a fasta file as input and outputs a fasta file containing B-cell epitope predictions. The output looks like this (capitilization=predicted epitope residue).

The first run might take a while because the ESM-2 models need to be downloaded to your torch hub model cache, if they are not already there. 
Alternatively if you already have esm-2 models downloaded (esm2_t33_650M_UR50D.pt and esm2_t33_650M_UR50D-contact-regression.pt), you can use them directly (see bepipred3_CLI.py script)

## Inputs ##

The required arguments are:

-i fasta formatted file containing the protein sequence(s).
-o Output directory to store B-cell epitope predictions
-pred {mjv_pred, vt_pred} Majorty vote ensemble prediction or variable threshold predicition on average ensemble posistive probabilities


Optional arguments are:

-add_seq_len          Add sequence lengths to esm-encodings. Default is false. This option is set to true for the web server.
-esm_dir ESM_DIR      Directory to save esm encodings to. Default is current working directory.
-t VAR_THRESHOLD      Threshold to use, when making predictions on average ensemble positive probability outputs. Default is 0.1512.
-top TOP_CANDS        Top % candidates to display in top candidate residue output file. Default is 20%.
-rolling_window_size  Window size to use for rolling average on B-cell epitope probability scores (linear epitope scores). Default is 9.
-plot_linear_epitope_scores Use linear B-cell epitope probability scores for plot. Default is false
-z	Specify option to create zip the bepipred-3.0 results (except the interactive .html figure). Default is false.

## Outputs ##
A total of 5 files are generated, where epitope and non-epitope residues are indicated with uppercase and lowercase letters respectively.

- 'Bcell_epitope_preds.fasta'. Contains B-cell epitope predictions for the protein sequence(s) at the specified threshold is generated.
- 'Bcell_epitope_top_Xpct_preds.fasta'. Contains the top x pct. candidates based on BepiPred-3.0 scoring. 
- 'Bcell_linepitope_top_Xpct_preds' . Contains the top x pct. candidates based on BepiPred-3.0 linear epitope scoring.
- 'raw_output.csv'. Contains the B-cell epitope probability scores for each residue of the protein sequence(s). The rolling mean score (linear epitope score) is also provided.
- 'output_interactive_figures.html'. The optimal threshold is often protein specific. This html file can be opened in any browser and allows the user to manually set the threshold for each protein and get the the corresponding B-cell epitope predictions. By default, these graphs are generated for the first 50 proteins in the fasta file due to file size contraints.

## Example ##

An example of a command from linux CLI,
python bepipred3_CLI.py -i example_antigens.fasta -o ./output/ -pred vt_pred 

This will ESM-2 encode sequences in example_antigens.fasta, make B-cell epitope predictions using the default threshold. Outputs files are stored in a directory clled 'output'.

The web server uses the -add_seq_len option. So to get the same output as the web server this argument needs to be added,
python bepipred3_CLI.py -i example_antigens.fasta -o ./output/ -pred vt_pred -add_seq_len

For more info, you can run,

python bepipred3_CLI.py -h

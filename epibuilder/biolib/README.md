# EpiBuilder-1
### _A Tool for Assembling, Searching, and Classifying B-Cell Epitopes_

### Features that you will have using EpiBuilder-1:
- Use your BepiPred3 predictions
- Epitopes list (including FASTA)
- Build your epitopes by length (min, max) and score
- Search your epitopes in proteomes (with or without BLAST)
- Received several output files including XLSX (please explore the results)
- Biochemical features such as: 

| Method | Description |  Reference |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| Chou and Fasman | Beta turn prediction  | [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/364941/) |
| Emini | Surface accessibility scale | [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2991600/) |
| Karplus and Schulz | Chain flexibility scale | [Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01195768) |
| Kolaskar and Tongaonkar | Antigenicity scale | [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1702393/) |
| Parker | Hydrophilicity prediction | [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2430611/) |
- Summary of your run
- Epitope topology (see your epitopes with their biochemical feature)

## The EpiBuilder-1 processes
![The pipeline](epibuilder-pipeline.jpg)
* You can download and run locally the EpiBuilder to use more detailed features. [Check it out](https://sourceforge.net/projects/epibuilder/)

## Input options
This version is adapted exclusively for Biolib, so the only CSV accepted here is the generated one by [BepiPred-3](https://biolib.com/DTU/BepiPred-3/)

| Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| CSV | file generated by BepiPred-3 (raw_output.csv)|

* BepiPred-3 presents a new score method (default 0.1512, previously was ~0.5)

| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| xlsx | Excel file with epitopes detail, search, topology and summary | run-epibuilder.xlsx |
| txt | Plain text with all informations and generated reports | run-epibuilder.txt |
| .log | Output software log | run-epibuilder.log |
| tsv | Detailed topology | run-epibuilder-topology.tsv |
